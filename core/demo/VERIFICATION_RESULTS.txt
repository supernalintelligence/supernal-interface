🎯 AI COMMAND SYSTEM VERIFICATION

✅ CONFIRMED WORKING:
- AI input field accepts text
- Command 'open menu' matches tool with 100% confidence  
- Tool execution actually opens the menu
- Console shows tool schema: {testId: open-main-menu, elementType: button, actionType: click}
- UI buttons correctly labeled as 'regular UI menu'

🔧 AVAILABLE COMMANDS TO TEST:
- 'open menu' → Opens navigation menu

- 'navigate to docs' → Navigation action
- 'send message' → Chat functionality
- 'clear chat' → Clears chat history
- 'show code' → Shows code example
- 'run test' → Runs test simulation
- 'delete data' → Dangerous action (requires approval)
