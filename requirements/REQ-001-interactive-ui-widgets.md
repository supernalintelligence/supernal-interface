# Requirement: Interactive UI Widgets with Tool Decorators

## Description
Create a clean component zoo section showing standard UI widget examples (buttons, forms, inputs, radio buttons, checkboxes, etc.) that are directly wrapped with @Tool decorators. This should be a small sliver above the main interface - like a standard website component showcase. Each widget demonstrates direct @Tool method execution with immediate feedback.

## User Story
As a developer testing the @supernal-interface system, I want to interact with standard UI widgets that are directly connected to @Tool decorated methods, so that I can see immediate results of tool execution and understand how the decorator system works in practice.

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Interactive UI Widgets with Tool Decorators
  As a developer
  I want to interact with UI widgets that execute @Tool methods directly
  So that I can see immediate results and understand the system behavior

  Background:
    Given the demo application is loaded
    And the UI widgets section is visible
    And all @Tool decorated methods are registered

  Scenario: Click a simple button widget
    Given I see a button labeled "Open Menu" in the widget zoo
    When I click the button
    Then the @Tool method "openMainMenu()" executes immediately
    And I see visual feedback that the action completed
    And the button shows its current state

  Scenario: Toggle checkbox widget
    Given I see a checkbox labeled "Enable Feature" in the widget zoo
    When I click the checkbox
    Then the @Tool method "toggleFeature()" executes
    And the checkbox state changes immediately
    And I see feedback that the feature was toggled

  Scenario: Select radio button widget
    Given I see radio buttons for "Priority: High, Medium, Low" in the widget zoo
    When I select "High"
    Then the @Tool method "setPriority('high')" executes
    And the radio button selection updates immediately
    And I see feedback confirming the priority change

  Scenario: Use dropdown/select widget
    Given I see a dropdown labeled "Status" in the widget zoo
    When I select "Active" from the dropdown
    Then the @Tool method "setStatus('active')" executes
    And the dropdown shows "Active" as selected
    And I see feedback confirming the status change

  Scenario: Submit form widget
    Given I see a simple form with name input and submit button
    When I enter "Test User" and click submit
    Then the @Tool method "submitForm('Test User')" executes
    And I see feedback that the form was submitted
    And the form clears after successful submission
```

## Technical Context

### Hierarchy Context
- **Supernal Level**: url-chat (demo interface level)
- **Scope**: UI widgets, @Tool decorators, state management, visual feedback
- **Data Flow**: User interaction â†’ UI widget â†’ @Tool method â†’ State update â†’ Visual feedback

### Related Components
- **Frontend**: React components with @Tool decorators, state management hooks
- **Backend**: @Tool decorated methods in UIControls class
- **Storage**: Local state management for widget states
- **Integration**: @supernal-interface/core decorator system

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Widget interactions must respond within 100ms
- **Scalability**: Support 20+ different widget types without performance degradation
- **Security**: @Tool methods must validate input from widgets
- **Usability**: Widgets must provide clear visual feedback for all state changes

## Implementation Notes
- **Key Implementation Points**: 
  - Each widget must be directly connected to a specific @Tool method
  - State changes must be immediately reflected in the UI
  - Widget interactions must not require page refreshes
  - Error states must be visually indicated
- **Constraints**: 
  - Must work with existing @Tool decorator system
  - Must maintain React component patterns
  - Must be responsive across different screen sizes
- **Assumptions**: 
  - @Tool methods return consistent response format
  - State management system can handle rapid updates
  - Users expect immediate visual feedback

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Individual widget components, @Tool method execution
- **Integration Tests**: Widget-to-tool method connections, state synchronization
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user interaction flows, visual feedback verification
- **Performance Tests**: Response time measurements, concurrent interaction handling

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All widget types (button, input, checkbox, radio, select) are implemented
- [ ] Each widget is connected to a corresponding @Tool method
- [ ] Visual feedback is immediate and accurate
- [ ] State changes are properly synchronized
- [ ] All acceptance criteria pass
- [ ] Tests are implemented and passing
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance requirements met

## Traceability
- **Test File**: `src/tests/playwright/ui/REQ-001-interactive-ui-widgets.spec.js`
- **Implementation**: `packages/@supernal-interface/core/demo/src/components/InteractiveWidgets.tsx`
- **Git Branch**: `feature/REQ-001-interactive-ui-widgets`
- **Related Issues**: [Links to GitHub issues]

## Changelog
- **v1.0.0** (2025-01-25): Initial requirement creation
