# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains detailed architecture documents that support the requirements defined in `../requirements/`.

  - Historical reference

## Relationship to Requirements

These architecture documents are **referenced by** requirements but contain **implementation details** that don't belong in requirement specs:

- **Requirements** (`../requirements/`): WHAT needs to be built, acceptance criteria, user stories
- **Architecture** (this directory): HOW to build it, technical decisions, implementation strategies

## How to Use

1. **Starting implementation?** Read the relevant architecture doc for technical approach
2. **Need to understand flow?** See `USER-COMMAND-TO-EXECUTION-FLOW.md`
3. **Planning demo changes?** Review `DEMO-ENHANCEMENT-PLAN.md`
4. **Migrating code?** Check `REQ-004-005-IMPROVEMENTS.md` for migration guide

## Updates

When requirements change or new technical decisions are made:
1. Update the relevant architecture document
2. Reference it from the requirement
3. Update this README if new documents are added
