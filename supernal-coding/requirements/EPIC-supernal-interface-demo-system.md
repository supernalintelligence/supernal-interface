# Epic: Supernal Interface Demo System

## üéØ Epic Overview
Create a comprehensive demonstration system for the @supernal-interface/core package that showcases three distinct but interconnected ways to interact with @Tool decorated methods: direct UI widget interaction, programmatic tool execution, and natural language chat commands.

## üöÄ Business Value
- **Demonstrates the power of the @Tool decorator system** across multiple interaction paradigms
- **Enables developers to understand** how to build AI-controllable applications
- **Provides a working reference implementation** for @supernal-interface integration
- **Showcases unified tool execution** regardless of interaction method (UI, programmatic, or conversational)

## üìã Requirements in this Epic

### REQ-004: State-Dependent Tool Exposure Detection ‚ö° FOUNDATION
**Status**: Draft | **Priority**: High (Foundation)
- Event-driven system where tools self-report their exposure state
- Real-time state updates (NOT_PRESENT ‚Üí INTERACTABLE)
- **Tool ID duplication detection** prevents registration conflicts
- **Auto-generates tool ID constants** for DRY test patterns
- Enables intelligent waiting by AI agents, tutorial systems, and test runners
- **Foundation requirement** - enables smart behavior in all other requirements

### REQ-005: Context-Aware Tool Discovery and Navigation Paths ‚ö° NEW
**Status**: Draft | **Priority**: High (Foundation) | **Dependencies**: REQ-004
- AI discovers WHERE tools are available (which application state/context)
- **Auto-detects tool contexts** via file paths, React tree, or DOM observation
- **Zero manual configuration** - no contextPath needed
- Automatic navigation path computation (A‚ÜíB graph traversal)
- Executes navigation steps and confirms context changes
- **Enables "execute anywhere"** - AI can run tools in any application state

### REQ-001: Interactive UI Widgets with Tool Decorators
**Status**: In Progress | **Priority**: High | **Dependencies**: REQ-004, REQ-005
- Standard UI elements (buttons, forms, inputs) directly connected to @Tool methods
- Immediate visual feedback and state changes
- Direct interaction without intermediate layers

### REQ-002: Extracted Tool Commands Interface  
**Status**: Draft | **Priority**: High | **Dependencies**: REQ-001, REQ-004, REQ-005
- Discoverable interface showing all registered @Tool methods
- Direct programmatic execution of any tool
- Metadata display and approval workflows for dangerous operations
- Shows real-time tool availability based on exposure state
- Shows tool location (which page/context) for navigation

### REQ-003: Natural Language Chat Interface for Tool Execution
**Status**: Draft | **Priority**: High | **Dependencies**: REQ-001, REQ-002, REQ-004, REQ-005
- Conversational interface for tool control
- Intelligent command matching and parameter extraction
- Same execution results as direct UI or programmatic interaction
- Waits for tools to be interactable before suggesting them
- Automatically navigates to tool's location before execution

```

## üéØ Success Criteria
- [ ] All three interaction methods produce identical results for the same @Tool method
- [ ] Developers can easily understand how to integrate @supernal-interface into their applications
- [ ] AI systems can discover and execute tools through any of the three interfaces
- [ ] The demo serves as comprehensive documentation for the @Tool decorator system
- [ ] Performance is consistent across all interaction methods
- [ ] Safety controls (approval workflows) work uniformly across interfaces

## üîÑ User Journey
1. **Discovery**: User sees UI widgets and understands basic tool interaction
2. **Exploration**: User discovers all available tools through the extracted tools interface
3. **Mastery**: User controls the application conversationally through chat commands
4. **Integration**: Developer understands how to implement similar functionality in their application

## üìä Key Metrics
- **Tool Execution Consistency**: 100% identical results across interaction methods
- **Response Time**: <500ms for any tool execution path
- **Tool Discovery**: All registered @Tool methods visible in extracted tools interface
- **Natural Language Accuracy**: >90% correct tool matching for common commands
- **Developer Adoption**: Clear path from demo to production implementation

## üöß Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Infrastructure (REQ-004) ‚ö° FOUNDATION
- Implement event-driven exposure detection system
- Create ExposureAwareTool wrapper with observers
- Build ExposureCollector singleton registry
- Auto-wrap tools in @Tool decorator
- **Must complete first** - enables all other phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (REQ-001)
- Implement basic UI widgets with @Tool decorators
- Establish state management and visual feedback patterns
- Create the foundation for tool execution consistency
- Use exposure state for intelligent UI updates

### Phase 2: Discovery (REQ-002) 
- Build tool registry scanning and display
- Implement programmatic execution interface
- Add approval workflows for dangerous operations
- Show real-time tool availability indicators

### Phase 3: Intelligence (REQ-003)
- Create natural language command parsing
- Implement fuzzy matching for tool discovery
- Add conversational feedback and help system
- Wait for tools to be interactable before execution

## üîó Dependencies
- **@supernal-interface/core**: Tool decorator system and registry
- **React**: UI framework for demo components
- **TypeScript**: Type safety for tool metadata and execution
- **Testing Framework**: Playwright for E2E validation

## üìù Notes
This epic represents the core demonstration of the @supernal-interface concept: that a single @Tool decorator can enable UI interaction, programmatic control, and AI conversation simultaneously. The success of this epic validates the entire approach and provides the foundation for broader adoption.

## üîÑ History
- **2025-01-25**: Epic created with three core requirements
- **Future**: Additional requirements may be added for advanced features (voice control, visual tool builder, etc.)
