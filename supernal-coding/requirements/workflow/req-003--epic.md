# Requirement: Natural Language Chat Interface for Tool Execution

## Description
Create a chat interface that interprets natural language input from users and automatically finds and executes the corresponding @Tool decorated methods. The system must provide intelligent command matching, execution feedback, and the same results as direct UI widget interaction or extracted tool command execution.

## User Story
As a user or AI system, I want to type natural language commands in a chat interface and have the system automatically find and execute the appropriate @Tool methods, so that I can control the application using conversational language without needing to know specific command syntax or find UI elements.

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Natural Language Chat Interface for Tool Execution
  As a user or AI system
  I want to control the application using natural language commands
  So that I can interact with tools conversationally without technical knowledge

  Background:
    Given the demo application is loaded
    And the chat interface is visible
    And @Tool methods are registered with natural language examples
    And the AI command processing system is active

  Scenario: Execute simple command with exact match
    Given I see the chat input field
    When I type "open menu" and press Enter
    Then the system finds the openMainMenu() @Tool method
    And the method executes immediately
    And I see feedback "‚úÖ Main menu opened successfully"
    And the UI shows the same result as clicking the menu button directly

  Scenario: Execute command with fuzzy matching
    Given I see the chat input field
    When I type "show navigation" 
    Then the system matches this to the openMainMenu() @Tool method
    And displays "üéØ Tool Match: Open Main Menu (85% confidence)"
    When I confirm or the system auto-executes
    Then the menu opens with the same result as direct interaction

  Scenario: Handle dangerous command with approval
    Given I see the chat input field
    When I type "delete all data"
    Then the system matches this to deleteDemoData() @Tool method
    And displays "‚ö†Ô∏è 'Delete Demo Data' requires approval. This is a destructive action."
    And shows approval buttons "Approve" and "Deny"
    When I click "Approve"
    Then the destructive action executes
    And I see confirmation "üóëÔ∏è All demo data deleted (DESTRUCTIVE action completed)"

  Scenario: Handle ambiguous command
    Given I see the chat input field
    When I type "send message"
    And multiple @Tool methods match this input
    Then the system shows "Multiple tools found: Send Chat Message, Send Email, Send Notification"
    And provides clickable options for each match
    When I click "Send Chat Message"
    Then that specific @Tool method executes

  Scenario: Handle unknown command
    Given I see the chat input field
    When I type "make coffee"
    Then the system responds "‚ùì I don't understand 'make coffee'"
    And suggests "Try commands like: 'open menu', 'send message', 'clear chat'"
    And displays available command examples from registered @Tool methods

  Scenario: Show command execution details
    Given I execute any command through the chat interface
    Then I see the command I typed displayed as a user message
    And I see the AI response with execution results
    And I see system messages showing tool execution details
    And I see the same state changes as direct UI interaction
    And the chat history preserves the conversation

  Scenario: Handle command with parameters
    Given I see the chat input field
    When I type "send message hello world"
    Then the system extracts "hello world" as the message parameter
    And executes sendChatMessage("hello world")
    And I see "hello world" appear in the chat interface
    And the execution matches direct UI widget interaction

  Scenario: Provide help and command discovery
    Given I see the chat input field
    When I type "help" or "what can you do"
    Then the system lists all available commands with examples
    And groups commands by category (Navigation, Chat, Demo Controls, etc.)
    And shows which commands are AI-enabled vs test-only
    And indicates which commands require approval
```

## Technical Context

### Hierarchy Context
- **Supernal Level**: url-chat (conversational interface level)
- **Scope**: Natural language processing, command matching, @Tool execution, chat UI
- **Data Flow**: User input ‚Üí NLP parsing ‚Üí Tool matching ‚Üí Execution ‚Üí Response generation ‚Üí Chat display

### Related Components
- **Frontend**: Chat interface, message display, input handling, approval dialogs
- **Backend**: Command parser, tool matcher, execution engine, response formatter
- **Storage**: Chat history, command patterns, execution logs
- **Integration**: @supernal-interface/core registry, tool execution system

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Command matching within 200ms, execution within 500ms total
- **Scalability**: Handle 1000+ chat messages without performance degradation
- **Security**: Validate all parsed parameters, require approval for dangerous commands
- **Usability**: Intuitive natural language understanding, clear feedback messages

## Implementation Notes
- **Key Implementation Points**:
  - Implement fuzzy matching algorithm for natural language to @Tool method mapping
  - Parse command parameters from natural language input
  - Provide confidence scoring for command matches
  - Handle approval workflow for dangerous operations
  - Maintain chat history and conversation context
  - Generate helpful error messages and suggestions
- **Constraints**:
  - Must work with existing @Tool decorator system and metadata
  - Must provide identical results to direct UI widget interaction
  - Must handle edge cases gracefully (typos, ambiguous input, etc.)
  - Must be responsive and provide immediate feedback
- **Assumptions**:
  - @Tool methods have meaningful examples for natural language matching
  - Users expect conversational interaction patterns
  - Command execution results are consistent across interaction methods

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Command parsing, tool matching algorithms, parameter extraction
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end command execution, approval workflows, chat history
- **E2E Tests**: Complete conversational flows, error handling, help system
- **Performance Tests**: Response time under load, large chat history handling

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Natural language commands are accurately matched to @Tool methods
- [ ] Command execution produces identical results to direct UI interaction
- [ ] Dangerous commands require approval with clear warnings
- [ ] Chat interface provides clear feedback for all interactions
- [ ] Help system enables command discovery
- [ ] Parameter extraction works for commands that need input
- [ ] Error handling provides helpful suggestions
- [ ] Chat history is preserved and searchable
- [ ] All acceptance criteria pass
- [ ] Tests are implemented and passing
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance requirements met

## Traceability
- **Test File**: `src/tests/playwright/chat/REQ-003-natural-language-chat-interface.spec.js`
- **Implementation**: `packages/@supernal-interface/core/demo/src/components/ChatInterface.tsx`
