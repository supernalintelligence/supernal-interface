# REQ-004: State-Dependent Tool Exposure Detection

## Overview
Event-driven system where tools self-report their exposure state (NOT_PRESENT, PRESENT, VISIBLE, EXPOSED, INTERACTABLE) enabling AI agents, tutorial systems, and test runners to know when tools are available

## User Story
**As a** ai-agent,test-runner,tutorial-system  
**I want** Event-driven system where tools self-report their exposure state (NOT_PRESENT, PRESENT, VISIBLE, EXPOSED, INTERACTABLE) enabling AI agents, tutorial systems, and test runners to know when tools are available  
**So that** Eliminates guesswork about tool availability, enables intelligent waiting, provides real-time state updates for all consumers

## Acceptance Criteria
